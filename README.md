# Gun-Detetcion
In this repository the code for detecting different kinds of weapon using YOLO 11x is discussed. This repository is trained using the available dataset available here: https://universe.roboflow.com/smart-weapon-system-with-computer-vision/drdo/dataset/1 .

The model is trained for 40 epochs using the AdamW(lr=0.001667, momentum=0.9).
